# Ven's Stock Revamp

*This part pack replaces several of the stock textures and models, hopefully making them more beautiful in the process.*

## Features

- Most parts in the base game (i.e. not from Making History or any future expansions) get completely replaced, but there are a handful of exceptions:
	- Spaceplane parts are generally left alone.  (The "Wheesley", "Whiplash", and "Panther" engines get some decorative turbomachinery added to the front of them.)
	- Squad's revamped fuel tanks, adapters, and probe cores are still available as variants (though Ven's models are now the default variant for them).
	- The revamped Mk2 Lander Can model is left alone, because looks nice enough and has new functionality.
- New parts are added fill some gaps in the stock range, including half-sized deployable solar panels, structural girders in multiple sizes and configurations, and a range of Oscar 0.625m fuel tanks.

## Dependencies

Ven's Stock Revamp depends on [**Module Manager**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/50533-140-17x-module-manager-403-august-9th-2019-right-to-ludicrous-speed/&tab=comments#comment-720814), a compatible version of which is bundled in the zip file.

## FAQ (First Anticipated Question)

- Is this mod compatible with ReStock?
	- Not as-downloaded.  However, if you delete the PathPatches and Squad subfolders, you can keep the new parts that Ven made and let ReStock have its way with the stock parts.

## Download and install

- [**GitHub**](https://github.com/Kerbas-ad-astra/Stock-Revamp/releases)

From there, just unzip the "VenStockRevamp" folder into your GameData directory.

Please let me know in [**the forum thread**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/189732-19x-vens-stock-revamp-resurrected-v1151-nattering-nodes-of-negativism-02020-mar-15/) or on [**the GitHub issue tracker**](https://github.com/Kerbas-ad-astra/Stock-Revamp/issues) if you find any issues!

	- Adjusted node positions of Ven's new Poodle model so that 'upgraded' vehicles don't have the bell sticking down into the decoupler below.
		- Moved old VSR Poodle model to new O-80 "Gale" Service Engine part (size 2 monoprop engine).
	- Re-enabled revamped wheel models (thanks @Enceos)
	- Re-enabled giant SpaceX-style landing gear (thanks @notquitehalf)
	- Added Part Variant support to Ven's engine models with optional tankbutts.
	- Added Ven's textures and models as default variants of aerodynamic fairings and Rockomax (size 2) tanks.

	- Adjusted node positions of heat shields (and Ven's Mk1 pod model) to fit better with flat-bottomed parts.

## Roadmap

I'll keep it ticking along as long as nothing breaks too badly with new KSP updates.

## Credits

The vast majority of the models are by Ven.  EmbersArc/Enceos fixed up the revamped rover wheels, and some configuration fixes were supplied by notquitehalf.  The majority of the configuration fixes were committed by yours truly.

And of course, thanks are owed to Squad for making part models that are worth revamping.  :wink:
