		// ********** Part: AerobeeMk1

		#AerobeeMk1_Part_description = A compact and lightweight 0.625 meter engine, the M82 produces plenty of thrust for smaller rockets in atmosphere, butnot enough to out-run 1.25m class engines, especially at higher altitudes. The M82 was originally developed for several of C7 Industries C-planes' experimental supersonic trials, but was later dropped due to availability concerns after a Rockomax Conglomerate import ban in the early 2240's. Most of the remaining prototypes have been mothballed and need extensive modification to avoid our current mix of LFO from eating away at several critical components.

This is thanks in part to its patented parabolic folding design. ISPE's research team maintains it was not inspired by an umbrella, but clearly this one is based on an umbrella.  Looks like the manufacturer forgot to put the protective fairing on it.  Still, it's a little lighter and they're willing to discount the price as well.
